# rockPaperYt
Python code for a simple Rock Paper Scissors game.
On launch, the program prompts the user for input from a selection of('r' for rock,'p' for paper, 's' for scissors).
If the user enters anything other than the given choices, an error message is printed and the user is prompted for valid input again.
The computer selects a random choice from the given choices and the program checks who wins (following the rock paper scissors logic).
If there's a winner, they are printed and the game exits but if there is a draw, the user is prompted for input until a winner is found.
